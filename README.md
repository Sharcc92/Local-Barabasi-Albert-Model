# Local Barabasi Albert Model
The Local Barabsi Albert Model is based on the NetworkX implementation of the Extended BA-Model, which can be found on https://networkx.github.io/documentation/stable/_modules/networkx/generators/random_graphs.html.


In the implementation we compare the BA-Model, the Extended BA-Model with the own Local Barabasi Albert Model.
In Addition to the Extended BA-Model, the Local Barabasi Albert Model, can focus on connecting to neighbors of neighbors to increase the community coefficient.

The principle is shown in figure:
